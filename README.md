# PaneKit

A lightweight and powerful preference pane framework

## Overview

Defaulter's (upcoming) support for custom panes allows users to optimize their workflow. With PaneKit, developers can do the same.

PaneKit is a framework that allows you to generate preference pane layouts from property lists (or JSON, if that's your thing). Developers have full control over how their panes are rendered.
